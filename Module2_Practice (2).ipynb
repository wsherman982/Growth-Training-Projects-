    "Assume a game in which two players, Player A and Player B, roll a six-sided die. The game continues until one of the players reaches a score of 50 or more. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. If both players reach 50 or more in the same round, the player with the higher score wins. If both players have the same score, the game is a tie. We will write a program that simulates this game and keeps track of the scores."
